### What to Expect

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly. We are committed to keeping you informed throughout the process.

### Responsible Disclosure

To protect the community, we request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a chance to address it. We will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and will notify you when a fix has been implemented.

Thank you for helping us keep SkyCyberIO secure!
